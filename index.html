<h>Demo Visualizations for Tracking Keywords in American Studies</h>
<p>Just found out a decent number of files didn't get processed the right way so this is all a demo and will not be the final results</p>
<!--<ul><a href="https://tcleary.github.io/InteractiveMultiv2.html">Interactive Line Chart</a></ul>
<p>The Interactive Line Chart allow you to pick out individual keywords, as listed in <i>Keywords for American Studies</i>, and see show they track over time.</p>
<p>To interact with the chart, click on one of the squares next to the keyword and the line will be graphed on the chart.  You can select as many keywords as you want.</p>
<p>When you hover your mouse inside the chart, you will see numbers apear next to the keywords.  These numbers are how many times the keyword appeared in that year.</p>

<p>The "Many Charts" graph recontextualized the data in the Interactive Line Chart.  Here each keyword has it's own chart, and scaled to itself (with the highest peak of each chart being the point where the keyword appeared the most) allowing to the user to see the general trend of the keyword across time. This view makes it more clear that the general usage of keywords has increased over time, showing how the <i>American Quarterly</i> has steadily included a more diverse range of topics.</p>
<p>This view is a quantified approach to support arguments and anaylsis by XXXXX that the American Studies field has been steadily been including a wider range of topics.</p>

<p>This bubble chart represents the topcis created with topic modeling using MALLET. The larger the area of a bubble the more weight it has on the field. If you click on a bubble you will see the words that define the topic and the weight between 0 and 1 that it carries.</p>
